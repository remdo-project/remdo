# RemDo Agent Guidelines

- Do not change any code before explicitly asked for it.
  - If asked how something can be solved, answer the question and suggest a
    solution.
  - If asked to propose code, provide the snippet and wait for explicit
    approval before making changes.
- Do not stage or commit any changes without explicit approval.
