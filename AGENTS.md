# RemDo Agent Guidelines

- Do not change any code before explicitly asked for it.
  - If asked how something can be solved, answer the question and suggest a
    solution.
  - If asked to propose code, provide the snippet and wait for explicit
    approval before making changes.
- Do not stage or commit any changes without explicit approval.
- The project is in dev phase, do not introduce temporary shims when refactoring
  or fixing bugs, but rather aim for pernanent solutions.
