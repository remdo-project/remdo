## About this file (scratchpad)

This file is an intentionally messy scratchpad for in-flight work, not a spec.

Rules:

- Mark completed items as `✅ Done` while a section is still active.
- Delete sections once fully done (no archive here).
- Move durable decisions/specs into the relevant doc under `docs/`, leaving a
  link behind.

## Tooling

- Consolidate repeated unit-test Lexical DOM setup (`document.createElement` +
  `document.body.append` + `createEditor` + `setRootElement`) into a shared
  test helper with a single cleanup path.

## Test doc-id lifecycle hygiene (deferred)

- We currently mix two strategies in tests:
  random doc IDs (which can leave per-run collab data on disk) and repeatable
  doc IDs (which require explicit pre-test cleanup and add runtime cost).
- Plan a unified test doc-id lifecycle approach so data isolation and cleanup
  are deterministic without ad hoc per-suite behavior.
